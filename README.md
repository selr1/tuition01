# Tuition01 System

## [Reflections](Reflections.txt)

I succesfully made the login ui for our system and for now i only put Tuition01 as the name, also only students login is accepted and the main screen ui
is the timetable. What i find dificult the most is the styling , thats why i also uploaded the no styling version on my github repo.
I also uses only 2 .json files as simple database for login credentials and timetable details, so users can edit the files themselves and view the changes directly and easily.
